## What has been done

- Add perk menu for selecting what type of tokengating the merchant wants.
- Add Shopify function that leverages the Cart and Checkout Validation API.
- Add contract query using Thirdweb's API.

There are lots of things that need to be done in order for this to be a Shopify marketplace worthy app. A detailed Project-Specification is available below.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a Shopify App that leverages Shopify and thirdweb's robust APIs and blockchain components to create token-powered commerce experiences that drive loyalty, foster brand collaborations, and empower communities. The app will serve a diverse set of merchants and buyers, be blockchain agnostic, and provide an easy-mode for tokengated loyalty and brand collaborations, abstracting away unfamiliar web3 patterns and focusing on ease of use.

## Features

#### Loyalty Program
- When purchasing an item and if the user has their wallet connected, they will receive a percentage of tokens from the brand itself.
- These tokens can be used to mint a brand NFT that is generated based on their past purchases.
- These tokens can also be used to upgrade the user's NFT.
- Higher-level NFTs provide bigger discounts on some items or special access to other items.
- These tokens/NFTs can also be used to provide brand engagement via voting for loyal customers, meaning customers can vote for characteristics of the next merch release.

#### Brand Collaboration
- The app will facilitate brand collaborations by providing a platform where brands can find and connect with each other for collaborations.
- Brands will be able to collaborate by minting a unique NFT that represents the collaboration.
- Customers will be able to purchase the collaboration NFT and redeem it for a limited edition product.
- Integration with Shopify API and Blockchain Components
- The app will integrate with Shopify's API and use Shopify Blockchain and thirdweb CommerceKit.
- The app will use smart contracts to manage the issuance, distribution, and redemption of tokens and NFTs.
- The app will also use smart contracts to enable secure and transparent collaboration between brands.

#### Easy-to-use interface
- The end-user experience will be simple and approachable, with a focus on ease of use.
- The app will abstract away unfamiliar web3 patterns and avoid using crypto jargon.
- The app will serve a diverse set of merchants and buyers, taking into account merchant size, industry, demographic, and web3 literacy.

## Deliverables
- A Shopify App that integrates with Shopify's API and thirdweb's blockchain components.
- Smart contracts to manage the issuance, distribution, and redemption of tokens and NFTs.
- A user-friendly interface that provides an easy-mode for tokengated loyalty and brand collaborations.
- Documentation on how to use the app, including a video demo.
